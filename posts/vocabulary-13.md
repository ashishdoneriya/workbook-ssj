The surreptitious manner in which Fadnavis was sworn in as CM, was admission by the troupe itself that this drama was beyond the pale (कमज़ोर).

**Amoral - नीतिहीन**  
Pursuit of power often involves amoral ingredients, but the surreal birthing of the new government was nothing short of sheer (सिर्फ) depravity (भ्रष्टता)

Politically indefensible as the Sena-Congress-NCP alliance might be, its claim to form a government is technically unimpeachable (स्पष्ट), and cannot be denied.

**Unimpeachable - स्पष्ट**  
Politically indefensible (असमर्थनीय) as the Sena-Congress-NCP alliance might be, its claim to form a government is technically unimpeachable, and cannot be denied.

**Defector - दलबदलू**
