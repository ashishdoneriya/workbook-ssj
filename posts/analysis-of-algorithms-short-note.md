### What is an Algorithm?
* An Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
* An Algorithm is a set of steps of operations to solve a problem performing calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks.
* An Algorithm is the best way to represent the solution of a particular problem in a very simple and efficient way.
* Algorithm is independent from any programming languages.

### What is Analysis of algorithm?
Analysis of algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem-solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size required.

### What is Time Complexity?
* Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.
* Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the measurement of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input.

### Big O notation
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario.  
Big O notation is used for the worst case analysis of an algorithm.

### Big Omega
Big Omega is used for the best case analysis of an algorithm.

### Big Theta
Big Theta is used for the analysis of an algorithm when the the best case and worst case analysis is the same.
