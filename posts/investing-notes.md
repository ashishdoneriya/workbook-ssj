The Warren Buffett Way

According to Buffett, the economic world is divided into a small
group of franchises and a much larger group of commodity businesses,
most of which are not worth purchasing. He defines a franchise as a
company whose product or service (1) is needed or desired, (2) has no
close substitute, and (3) is not regulated.
Individually and collectively, these create what Buffett calls a moat—
something that gives the company a clear advantage over others and protects it against incursions from the competition. The bigger the moat, the
more sustainable, the better he likes it. “The key to investing,” he says,“is determining the competitive advantage of any given company and,
above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that
have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.”14 (To see what a moat looks like, read the story of
Larson-Juhl in Chapter 8.)
