## Use of `Would`
**The expectation is happening right now.**  
** `Would` implies a person's willingness in the future to do something, but with a condition**  
There are fewer mosquitos than I would expect.  
He would go to the party if there was cake.


## Use of `Would have`
**The expectation happened in the past.**  
**`Would have` implies a personsâ€™ willingness in the past to do something but which did not happen**  
There are fewer mosquitos than I would have expected, but now I know it's because they just sprayed the area with mosquito repellent.  
He would have gone to the party if there had been cake.


## Use of `Would have been`
**Talking about a hypothetical past in which the person was never in your life.**  
My life would have been completely empty without you.

## Use of `Would be`
**Talking about a hypothetical future in which the person is not in your life any longer**  
My life would be completely empty without you.

I'll go to the dentist's as soon as I have (no future!) a toothache.  
What a mess! Your mother will be angry when she comes back. (no future!)  
I'll stay at home until you phone me. (no future!)  


## Use of `Has been or have been`
The present perfect tense refers to an action that began at some time in the past and is still in progress. For example, if I started studying art when I was 13 years old and I am still studying art, I would say "I have been studying art since I was 13 years old."

## Use of `had been`
"Had been" is the past perfect tense and is used in all cases, singular and plural. The past perfect tense refers to something that began in the past and was still true at another time that also was in the past. So, if I began studying art when I was 13, and I got married when I was 21, and now I am 55, I could say "When I got married, I had been studying art for 8 years." The "when I got married" part identifies a specific time in the past, and the "had been studying for 8 years" says that the studying was still going on at another time that is also in the past. Note that it does not matter, in this case, whether I am still studying art in the present - the sentence is correct either way.


Sentence : Counting of votes will take place on May 23, after all seven phases of voting are completed.  
Here When condition (seven phases) is used in future tense, and comes in the middle of sentense then 2nd part of sentence is written in present tense (here passive voice). But if 'when'/untill/as soon as keywords arrive at the starting of the sentence then in the end future present then will be used in the second part.

## Use of all/whole
when plural noun use all,  :: all - every , whole - entire, whole after a definite article (a/the)
whole - countable, all - uncountable,
every - single countable noun (singular)
was/were - were for unreal/imaginary situations
would/would have :: would - possibility , would have - possibility in the past
should have - mistakes in the past
had better - specific advice or consequence happen

for - used in reason, of - used for connection, to - used for direction, moving towards

Causative verbs are verbs that show the reason that something happened. They do not indicate something the subject did for themselves, but something the subject got someone or something else to do for them. The causative verbs are: let (allow, permit), make (force, require), have, get, and help. Let's take a closer look at the causative verbs.

have/get/make - I'm going to have my room cleaned. she made me wear a skirt. I've got my house cleaned

little - singular and uncountable noun ex - money, food, time
a few - plural nouns, a few clouds, songs

use passive voice when the actor or subject is not necessary


"I have been thinking about you" is past tense, and implies that you're not thinking about the person any more.
